# 🎓 Education Recommendation System

This project is a Machine Learning-based recommendation system designed to suggest personalized educational paths for students based on their interests, academic scores, and skill levels.

Developed using Python in Google Colab, it leverages clustering and classification algorithms to identify optimal learning tracks, including course recommendations and career guidance.

## 📌 Features

- 🔍 Interest-based course recommendations  
- 🧠 Machine learning models (KMeans, SVM, Random Forest)  
- 📊 Academic profile-based decision making  
- 📁 Clean UI and modular notebook design in Colab  
- 📈 Performance visualization using accuracy metrics and graphs  

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python 3.x  
- Google Colab  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ Prerequisites

Ensure you have a Google account and internet access.

### 🔧 Installation & Setup

1. **Open the Colab Notebook**  
   [Click here to run the project in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1i7T19m9z1YMDQ-Xwl4o3Z5tWa588fdYO?usp=sharing)

2. **Upload Dataset**  
   - You'll be prompted to upload the dataset (`data.csv`) if required.
   - The notebook handles loading, preprocessing, and model training.

3. **Run All Cells**  
   - From `Runtime > Run all`, execute the entire notebook.
   - Adjust parameters like the number of clusters or classification models if needed.

## 📦 Usage

1. **Input student details** (e.g., interests, marks)  
2. **Select ML model** for classification  
3. **View results:** recommended fields and courses  
4. **Analyze performance** via graphs and metrics

The notebook supports interactive usage — just update input cells and re-run sections.

- [x] Add classification (SVM, Random Forest)  
- [x] Graphical data analysis  
- [ ] Export recommendations as PDF  
- [ ] Deploy as web app with Streamlit
